# World-Map-Clock

I made this project using HTML, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript. It tells the Time and Date when clicked on a country in the Map.

The World Map that is used here is a SVG Map.

To get the correct Time and Date for every country i used an API from Abstract api (https://www.abstractapi.com/).
Time api (https://www.abstractapi.com/api/time-date-timezone-api).
